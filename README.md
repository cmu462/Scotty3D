# CMU 15-462 - Scotty3D

Welcome to Scotty3D! This 3D graphics software implements interactive mesh
editing, realistic path tracing, and dynamic animation. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/cmu462/Scotty3D).

Implementing the functionality of the program constitutes the majority of the coursework for
15-462/662 Computer Graphics at Carnegie Mellon University. The assignment description for mesh editing can be found [here](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/article/11). The assignment description for ray tracing can be found [here](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/article/17).

Further information is available in the User Guide and Developer Manual, both
available on the original project wiki [here](https://github.com/cmu462/Scotty3D/wiki).
