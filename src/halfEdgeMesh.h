/**
 * A HalfedgeMesh is a data structure that makes it easy to iterate over (and
 * modify) a polygonal mesh.  The basic idea is that each edge of the mesh
 * gets associated with two "halfedges," one on either side, that point in
 * opposite directions.  These halfedges essentially serve as the "glue"
 * between different mesh elements (vertices, edges, and faces).  A half edge
 * mesh has the same basic flavor as a tree or linked list data structure:
 * each node has pointers that reference other nodes.  In particular, each
 * half edge points to:
 *
 *    -its root vertex,
 *    -its associated edge,
 *    -the face it sits on,
 *    -its "twin", i.e., the halfedge on the other side of the edge,
 *    -and the next halfedge in cyclic order around the face.
 *
 * Vertices, edges, and faces each point to just one of their incident
 * halfedges.  For instance, an edge will point arbitrarily to either
 * its "left" or "right" halfedge.  Each vertex will point to one of
 * many halfedges leaving that vertex.  Each face will point to one of
 * many halfedges going around that face.  The fact that these choices
 * are arbitrary does not at all affect the practical use of this data
 * structure: they merely provide a starting point for iterating over
 * the local region (e.g., walking around a face, or visiting the
 * neighbors of a vertex).  A practical example of iterating around a
 * face might look like:
 *
 *    HalfEdgeIter h = myFace->halfedge();
 *    do
 *    {
 *       // do something interesting with h
 *       h = h->next();
 *    }
 *    while( h != myFace->halfEdge() );
 *
 * At each iteration we walk to the "next" halfedge, until we return
 * to the original starting point.  A slightly more interesting
 * example is iterating around a vertex:
 *
 *    HalfEdgeIter h = myVertex->halfedge();
 *    do
 *    {
 *       // do something interesting with h
 *       h = h->twin()->next();
 *    }
 *    while( h != myVertex->halfedge() );
 *
 * (Can you draw a picture that explains this iteration?)  A very
 * different kind of iteration is when we want to iterate over, say,
 * *all* the edges of a mesh:
 *
 *    for( EdgeIter e = mesh.edges.begin(); e != mesh.edges.end(); e++ )
 *    {
 *       // do something interesting with e
 *    }
 *
 * A very important consequence of the halfedge representation is that
 * ---by design---it can only represent manifold, orientable triangle
 * meshes.  I.e., every point should have a neighborhood that looks disk-
 * like, and you should be able to assign to each polygon a normal
 * direction such that all these normals "point the same way" as you walk
 * around the surface.
 *
 * At a high level, that's all there is to know about the half edge
 * data structure.  But it's worth making a few comments about how this
 * particular implementation works---especially how things like boundaries
 * are handled.  First and foremost, the "pointers" used in this
 * implementation are actually STL iterators.  STL stands for the "standard
 * template library," and is a basic part of C++ that provides some very
 * convenient and powerful data structures and algorithms---if you've never
 * looked at STL before, now would be a great time to get familiar!  At
 * a high level, STL iterators behave a lot like pointers: they don't store
 * data, but rather reference some data that is allocated elsewhere.  And
 * the syntax is also very similar; for instance, if p is an iterator, then
 * *p yields the value referred to by p.  (As for the rest, Google is a
 * terrific resource! :-))
 *
 * Rather than accessing raw iterators, the HalfedgeMesh encapsulates these
 * pointers using methods like Halfedge::twin(), Halfedge::next(), etc.  The
 * reason for this encapsulation (as in most object-oriented programming)
 * is that it allows the user to make changes to the internal representation
 * later down the line.  For instance, if you know that the connectivity of
 * the mesh is never going to change, you might be able to improve performance
 * by (internally) replacing the linked lists with fixed-length arrays,
 * without breaking any code that might have been written using the abstract
 * interface.  (There are deeper reasons for this kind of encapsulation
 * when working with polygon meshes, but that's a story for another time!)
 *
 * Finally, some surfaces have "boundary loops," e.g., a pair of pants has
 * three boundaries: one at the waist, and two at the ankles.  These boundaries
 * are represented by special faces in our halfedge mesh---in fact, rather than
 * being stored in the usual list of faces (HalfedgeMesh::faces), they are
 * stored in a separae list of boundary loops (HalfedgeMesh::boundaries).  Each
 * face (boundary or regular) also stored a flag Face::_isBoundary that
 * indicates whether or not it is a boundary.  This value can be queried via the
 * public method Face::isBoundary() (again: encapsulation!)  So for instance, if
 * I wanted to know the area of all polygons that touch a given vertex, I might
 * write some code like this:
 *
 *    double totalArea = 0.;
 *    HalfEdgeIter h = myVertex->halfedge();
 *    do
 *    {
 *       // don't add the area of boundary faces!
 *       if( !h->face()->isBoundary() )
 *       {
 *          totalArea += h->face()->area();
 *       }
 *       h = h->twin()->next();
 *    }
 *    while( h != myVertex->halfedge() );
 *
 * In other words, whenever I'm processing a face, I should stop and ask: is
 * this really a geometric face in my mesh?  Or is it just a "virtual" face
 * that represents a boundary loop?  Finally, for convenience, the halfedge
 * associated with a boundary vertex is the first halfedge on the boundary.
 * In other words, if we want to iterate over, say, all faces touching a
 * boundary vertex, we could write
 *
 *    HalfEdgeIter h = myBoundaryVertex->halfedge();
 *    do
 *    {
 *       // do something interesting with h
 *       h = h->twin()->next();
 *    }
 *    while( !h->isBoundary() );
 *
 * (Notice that this loop will never terminate for an interior vertex!)
 *
 * More documentation can be found in the inline comments below.
